      <h1>[ yaf404p ] - Yet another fancy 404 page</h1>
      <p>Woooah. Slow down there a little, overly inquisitive one. If you haven't noticed already, there have been a bunch of changes around these parts.</p>
      <p>Please update your links, bookmarks, and the way you've seen me all along. If you have no clue as to why you're here, close the stupid browser window now. Go out. Take a walk. Get a life. You'll thank me for being so rude someday.</p>
      <p>For those who've decided they need this more than a walk outside, you have some choices to make.</p>
      <h1>Pseudo professional</h1>
      <p>If you're interested in the professional me, want insight into my research, annoy me with newbie questions (which I do answer with a smile) regarding applications to graduate school and so on, follow this <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~hnarayan/">link</a>.</p>
      <div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~hnarayan/"><img src="work.jpg" alt="Work page URI photo." title="I'm a photo of a URI." /></a></div>
      <h1>Pseudo fun</h1>
      <p>If you're interested in the not so professional me, would like to stare at some poorly taken amateur pictures or amateur artwork, read a whiney journal and that sort of thing, follow this <a href="http://wahgnube.org/">link</a>.</p>
      <div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://wahgnube.org/"><img src="play.jpg" alt="Rendered with font sizes scaled" title="I'm a photo of a URI too." /></a></div>
