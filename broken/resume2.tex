%Research Project

\begin{category}{Research Experience}
\citemnobullet Carried out a research project with a team on {\sl Gaseous
Petroleum Fuels for Automobiles} which involved a modification of a
conventional gasoline run vehicle to run on Liquefied Petroleum Gas (L.P.G)
and proceeded with a systematic comparison of its performance with the
original system with regards to efficiency and emissions. This project was
carried out under the guidance and supervision of Dr.B.S.Murthy ({\sl former
Head of the Mechanical Engineering Department, IIT, Madras}). Our work was 
later accepted as an SAE paper.\\
