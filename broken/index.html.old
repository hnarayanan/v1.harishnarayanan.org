                  <font color="#333333">Welcome to my little waste of space on the internet. I am currently a graduate student research assistant (PhD wanna-be) at the Computational Mechanics Laboratory under the <a href="http://me.engin.umich.edu/">Department of Mechanical Engineering</a>  at the <a href="http://www.umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a> at Ann Arbor.</font>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  <font color="#333333">This (obviously) wasn't always the case.</font>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  <font color="#333333"><img src="images/harish2.jpeg" title="Harish's Caricature" alt="Harish's Caricature" align="right">I was born many moons ago in a far off land known to many as India. As a child, I was way below average when it came to physical exertion. (Actually, that's true even today. I just added the reference to childhood for a theatrical chronological effect). That coupled with general laziness gave me more time than most active kids to sit back, relax and observe all the wondrous events occurring around me.</font>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  <font color="#333333">Being curious of course, I had a lot of <i>"Why ?"s</i> and <i>"How ?"s</i> popping up almost continually. Anyway, a few years later I joined school and completed my early schooling in a city called Muscat. The purpose of school was supposedly to answer all those questions that I had. School did help, a lot, but the more I got to know and understand, the more curious I got. (Just plain greedy I guess). Feeling education there was beginning to numb their sons mind, among other reasons, my parents decided to return to my place of birth, Madras, India.</font>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  <font color="#333333">That's where I got to complete my schooling over two <a href="http://www.vidya-mandir.com/">schools</a>. Those were fun times. <i>Fun</i> as in things were all slowly beginning to make sense. From quarks to supernovae... I finally felt I was beginning to figure it all out.</font>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  <font color="#333333">How naive can a person be?</font>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  <font color="#333333">It's a pity, like one of my teachers later, so eloquently put it, knowledge is infinite, and our time to grasp it all is finite. Actually, it sounded a lot cooler when he said it, but you get the idea.</font>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  <font color="#333333">I digress. Returning to the central theme of this little monologue, "me", my love of mechanics then led me to complete my under graduation in <a href="http://www.svce.ac.in/department/mech/">Mechanical Engineering</a> at <a href="http://www.svce.ac.in/">Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering </a>under the <a href="http://www.unom.ac.in/">University of Madras</a>. (Why engineering and not just pure applied mechanics you ask? Well, let's just say the choices are far more limited where I'm from.)</font>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  <font color="#333333">When that portion of my educational life was completed, I was at cross roads. The choices I had at the time eventually boiled down to two - selecting between a research position at the <a href="http://www.iisc.ernet.in/">Indian Institute of Science</a>, and one here at the <a href="http://www.umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>. I guess it's blatantly obvious as to what I chose. (Why? Let's just say I prefer theoretical solid mechanics to fluid mechanics. Yes, and <a href="usnews02ranking.html">this</a> had something to do with it too.)</font>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  <font color="#333333">And here I am today.</font>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  <font color="#333333">If you're anything like me, you'd expect a page that boldly titles itself "about me" to have a lot of real info.

                  <p>
                  <font color="#333333">I'd have to say you're in for a disappointment.</font>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  <font color="#333333">This is more like the <i>"Chronological summary of the educational life (with no real relevant detail) of yet another student wanna-be scholar"</i>. I just figured <i>"about me"</i> is a more catchy title (not to mention far easier to type) than the more apt (and horribly verbose) <i>"Chronological summary of the educational life (with no real relevant detail) of yet another student wanna-be scholar"</i>.</font>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  <font color="#333333">I would be lying if I claimed I am too complex a human being to be described in an <i>"about me"</i> page. So, I won't. I'll just say, it's hard. I am different things to different people (as I guess most people are). Anybody from <i>DeathmaticiaN</i>, the gamer, to <i>wahgnube</i>, yet another free software zealot, to... <i>her-reesh</i>.</font>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  <font color="#333333">But in the end, I am just another average geek hoping tomorrow the world around me will make more sense.</font>
