                  <font color="#333333">These are blogs which have gained a higher level of "coolness", for different reasons. They were/are probably important to me, or probably relevant to an issue that I care(d) about or some such thing. Probably, I just liked the way I had articulated a thought or just proud that I was able to come out and say it. (Meaning, ones that weren't read enough in my <a href="http://actuality.wahgnube.org/">regular blog</a>, considering the amout of time and/or heart that went into them and will be made sticky here just so that you are forced to see them and com(pli)ment on my thoughts, presentation style or whatever you choose to.)</font>

They then go on to be the foundation of (or more often end up verbatim, because of the <a href="contact.html">site maintainer's</a> lack of time/enthusiasm or plain laziness, as) articles. These articles lurk in the various categories under the <a href="interests.html#original">interests subsection</a> of this page, the <a href="interests001.html#random">random articles</a> subsection, or some other section of this site. Therefore, you will see a good deal of repetitiveness (which I tend to think of as necessary redundancy, considering people's short attention spans) all around this website.</font>
