                  When it was a little warmer outside (fall?) I shot <a href="http://www-personal.engin.umich.edu/~hnarayan/images/Fall03/Picture20031011%20019.small.jpg">Bug's eye view</a>. Lying down on the ground getting that picture has an interesting story <a href="http://actuality.wahgnube.org/index.php?p=170">attached to it</a>. <a href="images/flamingleaves.jpg">Foli(arson)age</a> and <a href="images/aliengarden.jpg">Alien Garden</a> are derived from that photograph. Nothing big, just playing around with colour maps. The original photo was modified with <a href="http://www.gimp.org">The GIMP</a>.

                  A long long time ago, when I first started using my camera, I was lucky enough to take <a href="images/Picture20030405%20081.small.jpg">this photo</a> as a part of the <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~hnarayan/site/pictures001.html#winter03">instant stalactites</a> set. Thinking of how a real photo might have degenerated over a very long period of time, I created the <a href="images/oldplantphoto.jpg">Old Plant Photo</a>. The original photo was modified with <a href="http://www.gimp.org">The GIMP</a>.

                  On my way to the Ann Arbor <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~hnarayan/site/pictures006.html#artfair03">art fair</a> in the evening, the sun was at a nice position in the sky giving me a <a href="http://www-personal.engin.umich.edu/~hnarayan/images/Art Fair/Picture20030718 005.small.jpg">long shadow</a>. Since that picture was basically a black and white photo, I played around with it until <a href="images/bumblebeeme.jpg">Bumble Bee Me</a> was born. The original photo was modified with <a href="http://www.gimp.org">The GIMP</a>.

                  Took a few shots at the beach when I was in Miami, Florida. Played around with the colours to get the following. An <a href="images/alienbeach.jpg">alien beach</a> and a <b>very</b> cool <a href="images/moddedsun.jpg">sun partially obscured by clouds</a>. The original photos were modified with <a href="http://www.gimp.org">The GIMP</a>.

                  Well, someone needs a hair cut, and soon. What else can I say? Played around with some filters and color mapped it all alien style to get what I got. The original photos were modified with <a href="http://www.gimp.org">The GIMP</a>.

                  After walking along central campus for a really long time in "spring" looking for some flowers, the only really pretty set I could find was <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~hnarayan/site/pictures002.html#lspring03">this set of daisys</a>. I love the colours, but decided to see how it would be if it were red in the center instead of yellow. The original image was modified with <a href="http://www.gimp.org">The GIMP</a>.

                  This is the first time I've attempted to modify a photo digitally. The goal was to make it appear.. as thought it was created by patching small bits of colored paper. I decided to name it  <a href="images/cubisticstreet.png">Cubisticstreet</a>. This image was modified with <a href="http://www.gimp.org">The GIMP</a>.
