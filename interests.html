                  <font color="#333333">Though I know this isn't a very traditional "interests" style page, following their usual style, I guess I'll classify things a bit to retain some of the sanity of the (hopefully) patient reader. Since they haven't really been classified in any real order, you could just click the links below to jump ahead to something that catches your fancy, or just scroll down in (no real) order. I've tried to keep it to about a (relatively, of course) small paragraph per category so that this can be done, knowing that you're a busy person. Think of this as the executive summary and contact me for further details if you'd like.</font>

                  <font color="#333333">These different categories have been populated at different times. There will thus be no continuous train of thought between categories, or even in a given category. There will be gross (and small) errors, complete with a bunch of (probably known and still unfixed) typos.  None of them should be assumed to be "complete", and you should be checking back often to keep up with progress. To ease your pain (and mine), I've introduced some category classifiers.

                  <p>
                  <font color="#333333">As is the case with everything else in my life, my music tastes are very specific (read narrow). Like most hard-wired introvert brains (as elaborated on in <a href="">this book</a>), mine can handle depth but not breadth. I would say I primarily enjoy listening to (and definitely singing along) stuff that falls under a subset of "Alternative Rock". As is customary, and is easier from my point of view, I'd rather indicate my favourite bands and songs rather than "describe" in words what I like. I would classify myself, primarily, as an Oasis freak. I tend to stay away from everything else, read [this this this this .. and this and lots of other things].
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  [Picture of me with all my albums, or just the albums or whatever here]
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Actually, my the list of bands on my playlists here will (or should anyway) mirror the <a href="links.html#music">Musique links</a> subsection of the <a href="links.html">links page</a>. The top ten will include blah, blah, blah... I do also tend to listen to some new-agey stuff, but this has more to do with TV and marketing numbing my brain rather than actually loving (or even liking) the kind of sound.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  I am, for the most part, very into my music, and get all zealous/take to arms when someone says something anti-what I like. I do spend a <b>lot</b> of my time immersed in music, of different sorts, as long as it's the same sort I care about.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  But listening is not all I do. I have been trained in south Indian classical music (called Carnatic, if you're interested) vocals for more than half my time on this planet. This, in "real time units" would be somewhere close to 11 years or more. I've learnt under different teachers including [something][someone]. Of course, I tend to gravitate towards things that come easiest to me, and more importantly away from things that are hard. So, when my voice cracked around the end of high school (and I couldn't hit notes I wanted with as little effort as I planned to put in), and other time consuming and seemingly "faar more important" academics related things got in the way, I slowed down and eventually discontinued my training. My claims to fame include winning a ton of vocal music contests and singing on the radio. I've since then moved on to be the "informed critic". [The guy whose abilities you don't know (and hence fear) you know could do it, but would rather mock you instead]
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  [Note: I never said couldn't hit, I said, couldn't hit with as little effort as I wanted to hit. Such is the case with EVERYTHING in my life. If I (feel I) am good at something, I know it. I stick with it, and let it get into my head offseting the natural unconfidence.]
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  And on the performance side of things, vocals isn't all I've been involved in. Though it was the most [serious portion of it], I have attempted quite a few instruments and finally stuck with a few. These include a couple of percussion instruments called the tabla and the mridangam, and the piano. I never got terribly good at any of those or the others, but I hadn't really put in more than a few years into each of them. A few perfomances with larger groups on stage was as close to glory I got on these.

Hmm... calling me a free software <i>advocate</i> would be the grossest underrated statement ever. I mean, come on, look at me. [understatement?]]<br />

This is what an average person. A dude with shaggy hair and stubble in a <a href="">Free Software</a> shirt with a <a href="">Blender hat</a> and a <a href="">laptop</a> with tons of <a href="">penguin</a> and <a href="">gnu</a> pictures running, you guessed it, <a href="">GNU/Linux in all its glory</a>. Of course the linux kernel is only a standby while the brilliant chaps of the world code up the hurd. Then i'll be fully gnu a person.<br />

[ stallman, talks etc ]]<br />
[ music in all ogg]]<br />
So, advocate? I think not. Even zealot is barely comes close to how I feel about using <a href="">free software</a>.<br />
<br />
<a href="">Here</a> is an interesting (read long) conversation I had with someone else about using free software. Yes, ladies and gentleman, that is the way I talk. I try to spread the light. I try to do everything just short of forcing my beliefs on you. Ok, sometimes I try that too, but that's a different story.<br />
<br />
Why do I feel so strongly about it? Because child, fs is the first step to an fs. Software, ideas etc were always meant to be shared and improved as a community. Not one company or a group trying to control everything under their <a href="">evil empire</a>. Sharing is a load bearing portion of society. I won't let it be made to look like a crime with words like IP theft and piracy, no sir.<br />

There are a few organizations on our side [ insert them with descriptions here ]]. <br />
<br />
[latex, octave, ginac, gcc gdb, OOo, galeon, ximian, screenies in general..]]<br />
What do I do about it you say? I can't really code stuff useful for normal people. But I release everything I do within my power. I use fs on all machines I admin or are under my influence somehow. [ and people ]] .I educate people on the benifits and try to give them a reason to realize it is important. I support these organizations. I buy stuff who's profits go towards these causes. I dress like [ ]]. I am a walking, talking, unpaid ad, Remember this<br />
