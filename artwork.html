                  I was listening to <a href="http://www.linkinpark.com">Meteora</a> the other day when it struck me that I hadn't browsed the "enhanced" portion of the cd. So I popped the cd into my computer and went through some of the stuff there. Among other things, there was this pretty cool video called the "Art of Meteora" which gave a small peek at the process that goes into the art and the music this band creates. Anyway, this got my "creative juices" flowing. I rushed over to the <a href="http://www.linkinpark.com">Linkin Park</a> homepage, and found some stencils of their band logo/name. Since I'm particularly fond of Reanimation, I decided to work with that avatar of the text. Here are two of the results. They are supposed to be "opposites", the first showing the icy text forming over a cool blue lake. The other is a more metallic, hot, chrome feel which I feel has come out better. Of course, these images were rendered with <a href="http://www.gimp.org">The GIMP</a>.

                  Here is a simple image I've rendered at the university. It was made following one of tigerT's tutorials. I've called it.. <a href="images/night-large.png">Night</a>. This image was rendered with <a href="http://www.gimp.org">The GIMP</a>.

                  And here's another. It's based on a similar theme as the previous picture. I've called it <a href="images/origin.png">Origin</a> and it's supposed to be representative of the birth of a star. This image was rendered with <a href="http://www.gimp.org">The GIMP</a>.
